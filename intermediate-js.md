# Intermediate Javascript Assessments

### Without using Google answer the following:

1. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

.map() is used when we wish to iterate through an array and carry out an action on each element of the array. This returns an array of the same length.
.filter() is used when we wish to iterate through an array and return a new array of elements that satisfy a specified condition. This usually returns an array that is smaller than the original array.  

2. Why would you use object destructuring?

Object destructuring allows us to assign variables to various properties of an object. This allows us to more easily access object properties.

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

var is pre-ES6 and is used to declare globally scoped or functionally scoped variables. 
let is used to declare a variable within a block, and is thus block scoped. Variables declared with let can be updated, but not redefined.
const is used to declare constant variables. Just like let, const variables are block scoped. However, const variables cannot updated or redeclared. 

4. Why is testing important?

Testing is important for many reasons:
1.) It allows us to break problems down into smaller pieces.
2.) It helps us to avoid feature creep.
3.) It keeps us focused on the current objective.
4.) It helps us get closer to 100% test coverage.
5.) It helps us save time. 


5. What is a higher order function?

A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument and/or returns a function.

6. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Objects are the union between behavior and data.
Classes are a blueprint for an object.

7. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

I learned that React is a really complicated and I have a lot more work to do to fully grasp the React concepts. I also learned the value of taking breaks during mob/paired programming. 

### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements
Internal - by using a style element in the <head> section
External - by using an external CSS file


2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

A div is a block-line element while a span is an in-line element.

3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

Classes and ID's have multiple differences. A class selector is preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector preceded by a hash character (“#”). An ID should be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.

4. Name 4 semantic HTML tags.

<div></d>,<h1></h1>,<p></p>,<span></span>

5. What are three options for creating responsive design?

*I had to Google these
Flexible Layouts
Viewports
Media Queries

### Stretch: The following questions are potential interview questions. First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. What is front end development? Can you identify any tools/skills that are uniquely required of front end developers?

Front end developers specialize in the visual and interactive aspects of a webpage or application. Front end developers should be proficient with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

2. What is block scope in JavaScript?

const and let allow us to declare variables in block-scope, which includes the area within curly braces. Variables declared within a block-scope are only available for reference within that block. 

3. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?

Inheritance allows for objects to inherit properties from their parent objects, while also allowing them to specify their own unique properties.
